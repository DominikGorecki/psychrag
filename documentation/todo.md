# TODO

## Bigger Projects

[ ] mini RAPTOR / mini PaperQA2 RCS [link](./raptor-miniQa2.md)
[ ] branching off of query for customization 
[x] custom templates
[ ] Add corpus to `work`: psychology, philosophy, medicine, chemistry, etc.
[ ] Queue for automatically importing PDFs and Epub
 

## Minor Improvements

[ ] `sanitization/[id]/title-changes` -- make dynamic -- show changes, allow user to change them interactively


[ ] Semantic Chunking
[ ] Lock Document -- simplify cleaning

[ ] CONVERSION - Manual ToC LLM call not templated

## TO-DO 
[x] Sanitization - Suggested title changes -- should be more visual--change from, to, etc. 

## Going over process e2e manually

[ ] Make adding to DB easier -- pass in citation? 
[ ] After added to DB should open up `/sanitization/15`
[x] Manual ToC Extraction on `/conv/148/inspect_toc_titles` should have a template in settings
[ ] Template settings edit should indicate where the template is used
[ ] Add sources to the results page
[ ] For results I want to track the LLM used -- manual input show drop-down
[ ] On vectorize suggestion page--option to set everything as vectorize (generate automatically)
