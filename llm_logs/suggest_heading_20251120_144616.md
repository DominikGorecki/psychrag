## Heading Hierarchy Rules
- **H1 (#)**: Main chapters or major sections (from ToC top-level items)
- **H2 (##)**: Sections within chapters
- **H3 (###)**: Subsections
- **H4 (####)**: Sub-subsections
- **REMOVE**: Items that should not be headings (e.g., decorative text, page numbers, running headers)
- **NO_CHANGE**: Headings that are already correct

## Instructions
1. Use your knowledge of this work (if you recognize it) to understand its proper structure
2. Search the web for information about this work's structure if helpful
3. Compare the ToC from the database with the current headings
4. For each line number in the headings, determine the correct action

## Output Format
Return ONLY the changes in this exact format, one per line:
[line_number]: [ACTION]

Where ACTION is one of: NO_CHANGE, REMOVE, H1, H2, H3, H4

Example:
10: NO_CHANGE
13: H1
18: H1
19: H2
20: H3

Provide the complete list of changes for ALL headings shown above.
```
